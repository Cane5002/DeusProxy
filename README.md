# Project Summary

I was inspired by fighting games and their unique character designs as well as the complexity and depth of mechanics and inputs. One major point of contension in the FGC (fighting game community) seems to be on the use of mtion inputs and their inpact on barrier of entry into the genre. Through my research, it seems that fighting games lack strong PVE content which may be a contributing factor to this problem. Running practice tool over and over isn't the most fun way to learn and neither is being destroyed by someone of a much higher skill level online. Them's Fightin Herds has been praised for having one of the best tutorials and that gave me the idea to create a much more fleshed out PVE fighting game experience, focused on slowly introducing new mechanics familiar to fighting game players and to make a more fun way to learn the genre.
